# PROGRAMMING-TECHNIQUE-1
Programming Techniques (C++) is closely related to Computer Science because it emphasizes coding as a fundamental skill. Through writing C++ programs, I learn how to convert problem requirements into clear and structured code, use control structures effectively, and debug errors during development. This hands-on coding experience helps me better understand how computer science concepts are applied in real programming tasks and improves my overall problem-solving ability.
