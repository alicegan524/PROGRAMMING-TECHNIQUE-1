# PROGRAMMING-TECHNIQUE-1
Programming Techniques (C++) is closely related to Computer Science because it emphasizes coding as a fundamental skill. Through writing C++ programs, I learn how to convert problem requirements into clear and structured code, use control structures effectively, and debug errors during development. This hands-on coding experience helps me better understand how computer science concepts are applied in real programming tasks and improves my overall problem-solving ability.

## [Lab 1](https://github.com/alicegan524/PROGRAMMING-TECHNIQUE-1/blob/main/PT1%20LAB%201.pdf)
This lab helped me understand pseudo code, flow charts, and trace output. Pseudo code helped me plan program steps, flow charts made the logic clear, and tracing output helped me understand how the program works. Overall, the lab improved my basic programming skills.

## [Lab 2](https://github.com/alicegan524/PROGRAMMING-TECHNIQUE-1/blob/main/PT1%20LAB%202.cpp)
This lab helped me practice using for loops in coding. I learned how to write loops to repeat tasks and control the number of iterations. Some parts were challenging at first, but coding and testing helped me understand how for loops work. Overall, the lab improved my coding skills and logical thinking.

## [Lab 3](https://github.com/alicegan524/PROGRAMMING-TECHNIQUE-1/blob/main/PT2%20LAB%203.cpp)
This lab helped me understand how to use arrays in coding. I learned how to store multiple values and access them using indexes. Writing code with arrays was challenging at first, but practice helped me understand it better. Overall, the lab improved my coding skills and problem-solving ability.

## [Assignment 1](https://github.com/alicegan524/PROGRAMMING-TECHNIQUE-1/blob/main/PT1%20ASSIGN%201.pdf)
This assignment helped me understand flow charts and trace tables better. Drawing flow charts helped me visualize the program logic clearly. Using trace tables helped me follow how values change step by step during execution. Some parts were challenging, but the assignment improved my understanding of program flow and logical thinking.

## [Assignment 2](https://github.com/alicegan524/PROGRAMMING-TECHNIQUE-1/blob/main/PT1%20ASSIGN%202.cpp)
This assignment helped me understand how to define and call functions in coding. I learned how to organize code into smaller parts and reuse functions when needed. At first, passing values to functions was a bit confusing, but practice made it clearer. Overall, this assignment improved my coding skills and made my programs more structured.
